        Todo All the Things is an elegant self hosted todo list.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's free, opensource, self hostable, private, and minimal.

        All your tasks are stored in your own browser, they're not visible to anyone else. You can <a href="#" target="_blank">configure your own storage</a> like dropbox or nextcloud to sync tasks between your devices.

      <h2>Syntax</h2>
      <div class="example">
        <div>
          (A) task - desription @project +context !due tag:value
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        You can simply enter tasks as a simple sentence, but this syntax for <a href="#">due dates, projects, and contexts</a> provides a much more readable list. All segments are optional.
      </p>
