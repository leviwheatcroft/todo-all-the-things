        It's free, opensource, self hostable, private, and minimal.

        All your tasks are stored in your own browser, they're not visible to anyone else. You can <a href="https://github.com/leviwheatcroft/todo-all-the-things/wiki/Configure-Remote-Storage" target="_blank">configure your own storage</a> like dropbox or nextcloud to sync tasks between your devices.

        <div>

      </div>
      <p>
        You can simply enter tasks as a simple sentence, but this syntax for <a href="https://github.com/leviwheatcroft/todo-all-the-things/wiki/Syntax">priorities, projects, and contexts (and more!)</a> provides a much more readable list. All segments are optional.
