/**
 * diff - compares previous and current text files
 *
 * because textfiles are being compared, it's only possible to reliably
 * determine additions and removals, not updates. If you rely on line numbers
 * you could detect updates, however lineNumbers will change when completed
 * tasks are purged.
 *
 * by contrast tasksDiff, which diffs state, can detect which tasks have been
 * added, removed, or updated. However, after a dropbox import, tasksDiff
 * will report an updated task as an addition & removal, because the remote
 * storage  driver creates a new task and removes the old task rather than
 * updating a task in place.
